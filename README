# WUDS: Wi-Fi User Detection System

WUDS is a proximity detection system that uses Wi-Fi probe requests, signal strength, and a white list of MAC addresses to create a detection barrier and identify the presence of foreign devices within a protected zone. Designed with the Raspberry Pi in mind, WUDS can be installed and configured on any system with Python 2.x and a wireless card capable of Monitor mode.

## Setup

```bash
# iw is needed to control the wi-fi interface
sudo apt-get install iw
# sqlite3 is needed to interact with the database
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
# (optional) I use screen as a daemon for WUDS
sudo apt-get install screen
screen
# install WUDS
git clone https://LaNMaSteR53@bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/wuds.git
cd wuds
# edit the config file
vim config.py
# execute the included run script
./run.sh
# Ctrl+A, D detaches from the screen session
```
